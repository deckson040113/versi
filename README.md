## Usage

1. **First Launch**: If fnm is not detected, the app will guide you through installation and shell configuration.

2. **Main View**: Shows all installed Node.js versions grouped by major version. Click a group to expand/collapse.

3. **Install**: Click the "Install" button to browse and install new versions. Recommended versions are shown at the top.

4. **Set Default**: Click "Set Default" on any version to make it the default.

5. **Uninstall**: Click "Uninstall" to remove a version. A toast notification appears with an "Undo" option.

## Development

### Project Structure

```
fnm-ui/
├── crates/
│   ├── fnm-ui/        # Main GUI application
│   ├── fnm-core/      # fnm CLI wrapper library
│   ├── fnm-shell/     # Shell detection & configuration

```

### Commands

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code
cargo clippy

# Format code
cargo fmt
```

### Architecture

The application uses [Iced](https://iced.rs/) with the Elm architecture:
- **State**: Immutable application state
- **Message**: Events that trigger state changes
- **Update**: Logic to handle messages and produce side effects
- **View**: Pure functions rendering state to UI

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed development documentation.

## Requirements

- **fnm**: The application requires fnm to be installed. If not found, the onboarding wizard will help you install it.
- **Shell Configuration**: fnm needs to be configured in your shell for full functionality.
